New gallery app for three-lights.net

Install

You need the following things working before you can install this:

- MySQL (the current configuration, to not worry about this change all instances of adapter: mysql2 to adapter: sqlite3 in config/database.yml
- Ruby 1.9 (it was built in Ruby 1.9, for all I know it may work fine in 1.8)
- RubyGems

Go to the empty directory where you want to install the application. Run the following commands:

- git clone git://github.com/lyleunderwood/threelights.git
- bundle install
- rake db:migrate
- rails s

Point your web browser to http://localhost:3000 and you will see the empty gallery.
